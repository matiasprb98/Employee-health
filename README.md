This project focuses on analyzing employee health and absenteeism utilizing tools like SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization. 
Project Objectives 
The primary goal is to identify and analyze the health status of employees, along with workplace absenteeism. Additionally, I calculated wage increases and determine additional compensation for non-smoking employees.

Tools
Used SQL: Employed for data extraction and manipulation from the human resources database.
Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to enhance data comprehension.

Analysis Performed
List of Employees with Good Health and Absenteeism: A list of employees with good health was generated, alongside an analysis of absenteeism in the workplace. Line charts and donut charts were utilized to represent the data.
Wage Increase Calculation: Calculated wage increases based on predefined metrics and parameters.
Compensation for Non-smoking Employees: Determined additional compensation for employees who do not smoke, considering various factors and criteria. 
Absenteeism Dashboard Creation: Developed a dashboard to understand absenteeism based on an approved wireframe, providing a comprehensive overview of absenteeism patterns.


Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL and Power BI for analyzing employee health and absenteeism. By leveraging these tools, insights were gained into employee wellness and workplace attendance, enabling data-driven decision-making for organizational improvement.
